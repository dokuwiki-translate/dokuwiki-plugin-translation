My developer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP.
I have always disliked the idea because of the costs. But he's tryiong none the less.
I've been using Movable-type on several websites for 
about a year and am concerned about switching to another platform.
I have heard very good things about blogengine.net.
Is there a way I can import all my wordpress content into it?
Any kind of help would be really appreciated! best dating site uk
